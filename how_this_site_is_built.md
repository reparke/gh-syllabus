# ITP 348 – Introduction to Physical Computing

==**More information to be added later**==

In designing this course in electronics / internet of things (IoT), and
I wanted the content to be accessible for all users and I wanted to share it publicly. I hope you might find this useful for how to set up a similar system.

Special thanks to [Ryan Straight](https://ryanstraight.com/) for all his suggestions!

## My desired features are

- accessible output (lecture notes and slides)
- limit extra work (single file for publishable lecture notes,  in-class slide presentations, and web-viewable)
- easy to edit (when editing lecture notes, I want to focus on the content not the formatting or markup)
- a reliable tool that has community support and will exist in the future
- easy to convert notes to slides (ideally an add-on for the editor I’m using,  but at least it should be a quick conversion that can be run)
- drag and drop support for images (a bonus)
- compatible with GitHub readable markdown (since I want to make the content  open-source. Ideally I would like it to automatically create GitHub HTML)
- able to make illustrations / flowcharts / line drawings

#### My Lecture Creation Process

- Create / edit markdown files in Typora (images can be drag-and-dropped; simple graphics can be created in Inkscape)
- Open completed lecture files in VSCode. Use Marpit plugin to generate HTML (or PDF) slideshows
- Use GitHub to push changed files to course repository. Website will be auto-generated

#### My Assignment Creation Process

- Create / edit assignment writeups in Word.
- Export DOCX files from Word as markdown files using Writeage plugin
- GitHub to push changed files to course repository. Website will be auto-generated

#### Getting Started

##### GitHub Site

- [Starting GitHub Pages Site](https://github.com/jan-martinek/gh-syllabus) This was an invaluable resource. I adapted ("forked") this site and added my own content
- [GitHub Jekyll Template Help](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation/#scenario-8-retrieving-items-based-on-front-matter-properties) In order to customize the system, I needed to adapt the GitHub Pages theme, which is called Jekyll
