Assignment 1 – Basic Blink
==========================

*[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu)*


Goals
-----

-   Test software installation

-   Test device configuration

## Requirements

-   Connect to additional Wifi networks (optional)

-   Create a Workbench project

-   Setup project settings

-   Flash firmware to device

### Connect to additional Wifi networks

-   The Photon 2 can remember the settings for multiple Wifi networks (just like a
    phone). If you need to configure for a different network than the one you
    first connected it, simply follow the instructions in assignment 0 again or go through process at  [https://setup.particle.io/](https://setup.particle.io/)

### Create Workbench Project

-   Follow the instructions to create a Workbench project:  
    <https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/workbench/#create-a-project>

-   Complete only the first step (do not move onto **Compile Project**

### Setup device settings

-   In Workbench, Go to View \> Command Palette

-   Type **Particle: Configure Project for Device.**

-   Select the device OS version you want to like to build for. It is
    recommended to use the latest stable version (this means the highest
    numbered version *without* **rc** or **beta** in the name). This means you
    are using the newest version of the operating system that is not being test
    (and so presumably it does not have bugs or errors). In the picture below,
    the latest stable version has been noted.

-   Select the type of device to you want to build for. For our course, we will
    always use **Photon 2 / P2**

-   Enter the name of the device you want to flash to. This will be the name
    gave your device when you initially connected it to your Particle account.

### Creating Your Firmware

<img src="media/abff6159b011e556f68ec286cbd333cb.png" alt="IDE" style="width:400px" />



- In the CPP file that opened when you created a project, paste the following
  code into `void setup()`:
  
  ```c++
  pinMode(D7, OUTPUT);
  ```

- and paste the following code into `void loop()`:
  ```c++
  digitalWrite(D7, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(D7, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  ```
  
   

### Flash Firmware to Device

-   In the Command Palette, type **Particle: Cloud Flash**
-   It may take a few minutes to successfully complete. When the firmware has
    been successfully installed, you should see the light on the device (labelled "D7") near the
    USB port blinking blue.

**Naming convention** 

*(replace \# with the current assignment number)*

-   **Project Name**: `itp348_a#_lastname_firstname`

-   **Zip File** (project folder): `itp348_a#_lastname_firstname.zip`

Deliverables
------------

*[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu)*
