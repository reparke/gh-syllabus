Assignment 2 – Light Sculpture
==============================

*[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu)*


Goals
-----

-   Connect LEDs to Argon

-   Create engaging art piece

**Overview**

This assignment is to create a physical art sculpture using the Argon and LEDs.
The specifics of what the sculpture looks like or what it does is entirely up to
you. You can put LEDs on a box, on a card, inside straws or ping-pongs, etc. One
suggestion is that you can use “extending” jumper wires (female-male) to have
the LEDs away from the breadboard. If you want to use these, ask the instructor.

Some example are below.
