Final Project
=============

[Submit on Blackboard](https://blackboard.usc.edu/)

Goals
-----

-   Create a connected device prototype of your own design

-   Device should demonstrate mastery of the concepts discussed in the course

-   Device should include elements not explicitly covered in class

Overview
--------

The project is to create a prototype of a connected device. The final submission
does not need to be “ready for manufacturing” but it must work and demonstrate
the key functioning elements.

**Project Requirements**

-   Be designed and built by the student solely. Inspiration may be taken from
    online and other sources, but sources must be cited and final project must
    be substantially different.

-   Use at least two sensors we discussed in class

-   Use at least two actuators (e.g. switch, button, etc.)

-   Use cloud / internet connectivity in a meaningful way

-   Must send data to a cloud system or storage

-   Must receive feedback from cloud system to produce effects in the physical
    world (i.e. control device remotely)

-   Must have an interface app to enable communication between a user and a
    device. It is recommended to use Losant but other systems may be used

-   Comment your code and follow consistent coding convention

-   Developer and user documentation (see below)

-   Your project has to compile and run *(projects that fail to run will receive
    a 50% penalty)*

-   No late submission will be accepted

-   Note: in the coming weeks we will discuss the following components in case
    you want to include them in your project

    -   Losant IoT cloud framework (for interacting with and making web apps)

    -   Digital temperature and humidity sensor,

    -   Ultrasonic distance sensor

    -   accelerometer

**Possible Project Ideas**

-   Head-mounted collision-detection and navigation wearable

-   Earthquake monitor

-   Retrofitted children’s toy

-   Home monitoring station

Deliverables
------------

**Proposal – due 4/6/20 at 11:59 pm**

-   Write a proposal document with following details:

    -   Describe the problem or need you have identified, why you believe it is
        necessary to address, and how your device would address this need.

    -   Describe the target audience

    -   List the key features, sensors, interaction patterns (e.g. how will
        users interact with the device), and internet / cloud platforms

    -   Rough budget for how much it would cost to build your device. You should
        include items in your kit as well as items not in your kit (e.g.
        building supplies, other sensors, etc.)

-   *Note: If you later modify your project from your original proposal, you
    must submit a revised proposal which describes any changes. Failure to do
    will lose 10%*

**Project Milestone – in-class 4/26/20**

-   Requirements

    -   Fritzing diagram

**Project – final deliverables and demonstration due 5/7/29 during final exam time**

-   In-person demonstration

-   Photograph / video or device

-   C++ source code (on Blackboard)

-   Interface app (provide link on Blackboard)

-   Device prototype (bring to class

-   Developer documentation

    -   Assume a future ITP348 student is taking the course and told to make a
        specific change to your project (add a feature, fix an error, etc.).

    -   Provide instructions how to setup your device and then explain key
        elements (include any other helpful documentation like sequence
        diagrams, Fritzing diagrams, etc.)

    -   Consider the following:

        -   What would they need to know to setup your project and get it
            running?

        -   What would they need to know to modify it? (Assume that they don’t
            want to read through all your code - they want some sort of a quick
            start guide that will help them identify where they should start
            looking/working first)

        -   Give a general overview of all aspects of your project with
            sufficient detail for them to know where to look to make
            modifications.

-   User documentation

    -   Assume a non-technical person would like to use your device. What do
        they need to know to get started and to use specific features? (You can
        omit initial setup)

**Submission**

-   Submit all documents via Blackboard

-   Bring device to in-person project demonstration

**Required naming convention** (replace \# with the current assignment number)

-   **Project Name**

    -   itp348_project_lastname_firstname

-   **Zip File** (include entire project folder)

    -   itp348_project_lastname_firstname.zip
