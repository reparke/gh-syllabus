## Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of physical
computing systems through hands-on, real-life applications. Physical computing
forms the basis of **smart devices**, **wearables** like smart watches,
**e-textiles / fashion**, **IoT (Internet of Things) devices**, and hardware
start-up

This course is designed specifically for a **general audience** and **all
majors**. You will learn to design electronic devices that interact with the
physical world. Assignments will use **motion detectors**, **robotic arms**, and
**electronic music generation**.

This course teaches students to design electronic devices that interact with the
physical world by building circuits and developing software algorithms that run
on a microcontroller. Students are expected to be familiar with introductory
programming, but **no prior experience with electronics or microcontrollers is
necessary.**

## Learning Objectives

-   Design a device using a microcontroller and electronic components. 
2.	Produce an embedded device that measures environmental conditions and sends readings to a cloud storage platform. 
3.	Produce an embedded device that produces effects in the physical world to accomplish a task.
4.	Build an interface app to enable communication between a user and a device.
5.	Control a device from an interface app.
6.	Describe accessibility challenges for an embedded device and suggest modifications.

## Learning Outcomes

-   Design a simple device that reads sensor data and communicates with an
    internet-based storage platform

-   Determine the appropriate electronic component for specific operations

-   Use a microcontroller to communicate with sensors and motors

**Prerequisite(s):** ITP 115 or ITP 165 or ITP 109 (equivalent courses or
knowledge will be considered)

### Format

This course will make use of Blackboard for content and assignments. Lecture
slides and any supplemental course content will be posted to Blackboard for use
by all students. Any and all announcements for the course will be posted to
Blackboard. All assignments will be posted to Blackboard and will be submitted
through Blackboard. **Students must familiarize themselves with Blackboard
before the course begins**.

### Course Kit

Students will be required to purchase a kit at the USC bookstore for this
course. This kit is created specifically for the course and must be purchased
during the first week of class. Additional components will be provided by the
instructor

### Required Readings

Readings will be posted on Blackboard during the semester.

## Course Deliverables

### Hardware Assignments

There will be hardware assignments that are due 1 week after being assigned.
These assignments require building a hardware device with the microcontroller.
Students will typically submit code, a schematic drawing, a photograph of the
finished device, and a video of the device functioning. Code from external
sources may be used as a reference, as long as it is properly cited. These are
to be completed individually unless otherwise noted.

### Programming Assignments

There will be programming assignments which will focus on a further
understanding of problem-solving, algorithms, and logical thinking using C, and
are due 1 week after being assigned. Assignments are to be completed
individually and submitted on Blackboard.



### Final Project Details

#### Schedule

- Week 10 – Project assigned
- Week 11 – Submit project proposal
- Week 12 – Receive feedback on proposal; submit device schematic
- Weeks 12 – 14 – Work on project (in-class milestone week 12)
- Final exam period – Final presentation (Graded)

#### Basic Requirements

The final project is to create a physical device and interface. The concept
of the device is up to the student, but the project proposal must be
approved by the instructor. The proposal should include device
functionality, part list, cost, and a general description of the app.

The final project will be graded on how it fulfills the requirements and the
quality / completion of the device. A project must represent the student’s
sole effort; online tutorials or class examples may be consulted, but they
must be improved upon and noted in the final documentation. Failure to note
and provided links to any reference material will be considered cheating.

#### Project Grading Breakdown

| Item                        | Points |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| Proposal                    | 10     |
| Device schematic            | 20     |
| Device firmware (C++)       | 25     |
| Web or mobile interface app | 20     |
| Functional device           | 25     |
|                             |        |
| Total                       | 100    |

#### Project Demonstration

Students will sign up for a 10 min window during the final exam time during
which their will demonstrate the functionality of their project. No
PowerPoint presentation is needed; rather, students will show the how their
device fulfills the key project requirements. Additional time slots will be
added depending on size of the class.

## Course Grading Breakdown

| Item                      | % of Grade |
| ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Participation             | 10         |
| Assignments               | 40         |
| In-Class Labs and Quizzes | 20         |

|                           |            |
| Total                     | 100%       |

### Grading Scale

Course final grades will be determined using the following scale

- A 93-100
- A- 90-92
- B+ 87-89
- B 83-86
- B- 80-82
- C+ 77-79
- C 73-76
- C- 70-72
- D+ 67-69
- D 65-66
- F 64 and below

### Grading Timeline

Assignments will receive feedback after about one week.

### Policies and Expectations

Students are expected to:

-   Attend and participate in lecture discussions

-   Attend and complete weekly assignments

### Grading Issues

Students will have one week after graded feedback is given to contest scores
(e.g. assignments, midterm, and project). After two week, scores will not be
changed.

### Late Policy

-   Assignments are due on the stated day on Blackboard (typically at 11:59 pm)

-   Students are given 3 “grace days” (self-granted extensions) which may be
    used for extra time without penalty

-   Grace days may be used for assignments only, **not the final project**

-   Grace days may be used for one assignment, distributed them across several
    assignments, or even better, saved them for a crisis that thankfully never
    comes

-   Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are
    used and only given in rare, exceptional situations

-   **Late work will not be accepted after all the grace days have been used**

Important: it is the responsibility of the student to state in their Blackboard
submission that they intend to use a grace day.

## Academic Conduct

Plagiarism – presenting someone else’s ideas as your own, either verbatim or
recast in your own words – is a serious academic offense with serious
consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism
in *SCampus* in Part B, Section 11, “Behavior Violating University Standards”
<https://policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b/>.  Other forms of academic dishonesty
are equally unacceptable.  See additional information in *SCampus *and
university policies on scientific
misconduct, [http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct](http://policy.usc.edu/scientific-misconduct/).
