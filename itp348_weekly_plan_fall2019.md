#### General Feedback

* Assignment 0 is given out week 1, day 1; due week 2, day 2; that is the pattern
* change A1 blink so that it gives out code to make D7 blink, or change the name of the assignment to something like **initial project**
* Develop a way to post readings on website
* Try to integrate lectures, readings, assignments all on one webpage under "weeks"
* Add to Assignment 0 how to install fritzing parts for Argon (from Rob github)
* students like being show a small bit of using a sensor, and then extending it on their own
* students like hands-on
* order
  * more LED colors
  * more M-F extension wires
* student kit could include more variety of colors / shapes of LED
* Include finite state machines; then assignment of simon says (could use buzzer)
* Include Fritzing installation of parts in A0 installation (beware Mac issues; for windows show how to import FZBZ file since students won't be able to double click )
