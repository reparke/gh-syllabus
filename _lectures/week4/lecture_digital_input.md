# Digital Input

# Review

## Analog vs. Digital

  - Analog: **infinite** variations / states
  - Digital: **discrete** (or **finite**) states


## Digital

- Instead of being infinite, digital signals are **discrete** (or **finite**)

- Think binary: the switch is either **on** or **off** (not "a little bit on")

- Digital values often have more than just two states--but they still have a fixed number of possible values (e.g. integer values 0-255)

## What are examples of digital output?

## Digital Output

```c++
void setup() {
    pinMode(SOME_PIN, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() { 
    digitalWrite(SOME_PIN, HIGH); //or LOW
```

- Most pins on the Argon can be configured to SEND output (e.g. to turn on a light) or to RECEIVE input (e.g. a button press)

- **HIGH** / true is **5V** (pin VUSB) or **3.3V** (pin 3.3v)
- **LOW** / false is **0V** (ground)

## What about digital input?

- What are examples of digital inputs?


## Digital Input

- Pins D2-D8 can be used for digital input *(other pins can also be used)*
- Argon will "read" the voltage on a pin and return HIGH (3.3V) or LOW (0V)
- **Never exceed 3.3V on input**
  - Be careful of other components that operate at 5V

## Reading Digital Input with `digitalRead` 

Syntax

```c++
int value = digitalRead(PIN_NUMBER);
//value is either HIGH or LOW (HIGH and LOW are defined as constants)
```
