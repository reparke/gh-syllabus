## What it is

* Soldering ("sah-dering") is the the process of melting metal (also called *solder*) to create connections between components
* Solder serves both to make electrical connection and provide some attachment of components

## Why do I care?

* Soldering is a critical skill in working with electronics
* Many breakout boards and components come soldering without headers
* Soldering allows us to design custom PCB to create more permanent projects (as opposed to using the breadboard)

## Safety Tips

* The tip is **very hot!** Don't touch it, and always return it to stand when not using
* Use clamps or vise to hold wires because they will get hot
* Wear eye protection (especially when cutting the ends of components)
* Keep food and drink away when soldering, and wash hands thoroughly when done 

## How to Solder

* Make sure iron has reached desired temperature
* "Tin" the solder by applying a small amount of solder to tip
* Use tip to heat board and pin evenly
* Apply solder to other side of pin
  * Avoid putting solder directly on tip
* A good solder joint will resemble a Hershey's Kiss
