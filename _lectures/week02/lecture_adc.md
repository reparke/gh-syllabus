# Analog to Digital Conversion

## Analog vs. Digital

* Analog: **infinite** variations / states
* Digital: **discrete** (or **finite**) states
* How do we represent infinite variations in a system that has limited / finite values?

## Analog to Digital Conversion

* Photon 2 is a digital system so we need to convert the infinite analog input to a discrete values
* At regular intervals, the Photon 2 **samples** ("reads") voltage on analog input pin it sees 
  - The **sampling frequency** is how many times per second
* The **resolution** is how many bits are used to store the voltage
    - Higher resolution means greater detail, but also more bits (more memory)

## Understanding Resolution

* Red line is actual analog input voltage (in volts)
* Blue line is the digital sample value (just a number with no units)

<!-- red line is the analog input; blue line is the sampling
left: 2 bit resolution; 2^2 = 4 buckets
right: 3 bit resolution; 2^3 = 8 buckets
-->

## Photon 2 ADC Resolution is 12-bits

* When we read the analog input voltage, ADC converts the voltage to a number
* There 2^12=4096 possible values (think "buckets")
* In Binary
    - 0 = 000000000000
    - 4095 = 111111111111

## ADC Pins

* `A0`
* `A1`
* `A2`
* `A5`
* `A3` (`SDA` or `D0`)*
* `A4` (`SCL` or `D1`)*

*You can use either of these pins labels*

## Photon 2 ADC

* The range of analog voltage is 0v to 3.3v
* The range of digital values is 0 to 4095
* Q: How many digital values per 1v?
* Q: How many volts per each digital value?
* Q: If there is 3.3v on an analog input, what is the value of `analogRead()`?
* Q: If there is 1.67v on an analog input, what is the value of `analogRead()`?

<!-- 3.3v = 4095 so 1v spans 1240 units
or 1 unit = 4095/3.3 -> so 1 unit is 0.8 mV
1.67v is 2047 
-->

* Connect potentiometer to A0
* Connect LED to pin A2 (do we need a pin with PWM?)
* Control LED brightness with potentiometer
