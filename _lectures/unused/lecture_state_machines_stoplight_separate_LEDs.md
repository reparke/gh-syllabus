## In class Lab - Stoplight and Pedestrian Signal

* We are going to build a stoplight for a two way intersection with a diagonal pedestrian crossing (meaning all traffic stops)
  * also known as a pedestrian scramble
* Here is how this type of intersection works

## Wiring Diagram
![bg contain right](lecture_state_machines_stoplight.assets/IMG_8948.jpg)
You'll need

* 2 green LEDs
* 2 yellow LEDs
* 3 red LEDs
* 1 white LED
* 6 330 Ohm resistors

## Wiring Pin Guide

| LED                   | Argon Pins |
| ---------------------------- | ---- |
| NorthSouth Red LED      | D2     |
| NorthSouth Yellow LED  | D3      |
| NorthSouth Green LED  | D4      |
| WestEast Red LED    |   A0   |
| WestEast Yellow LED  |     A1 |
| WestEast Green LED   | D5     |
| Walk White LED     |  D6    |
| Don't Walk Red LED   |  D7    |

## Lab Stages
1. North South stop light
2. Add Pedestrian Walk / Don't Walk light
3. Make Don't Walk light blink
4. Add West East stop light

* We will work through stage 1 together
* You will work in pairs implement stages 2-4, and we will review together as a class after each stage

## General Approach

* We will need to create a way to represent the states using `enum`
* We will need to track state transitions with **variables** for state
* We will need to control timing with `millis()`

* What does `loop()` do
  * calculate new state
  * output traffic signal LEDs based on state
  * independently flash walk signal *(later)*
